<insert stuff about you, mgc>



<!--- hey so mgc whenever you want to add a link, either do the <a> tag, or do this cool thing where you put links at the bottom formatted like [hiddentag]: <link> and in the body you put [Display name][hiddentag] here's an example: -->

link: [exampledisplayname][examplehiddentag] (this is for mgc so he can learn how to use markdown)


[Design][mjt] from [Alex Carpenter][ac]

<!-- you can keep the hiddentags and links at the bottom so they don't clutter -->
