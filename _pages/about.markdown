Here's some links that will take you to whereever you want. Btw thanks to Mi460 for helping me build this website :)



<!--- hey so mgc whenever you want to add a link, either do the <a> tag, or do this cool thing where you put links at the bottom formatted like [hiddentag]: <link> and in the body you put [Display name][hiddentag] here's an example: -->

[Link to my discord server][discord]

[Link to YouTube Channel][youtube]

[Design][mjt] from [Alex Carpenter][ac]

[ac]: https://github.com/alexcarpenter
[mjt]: https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme
[discord]: /discord
[youtube]: /youtube
<!-- you can keep the hiddentags and links at the bottom so they don't clutter i'm updating some crap for you lol 5/7/20 9:00PM-->
