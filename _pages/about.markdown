<insert stuff about you, mgc>



<!--- hey so mgc whenever you want to add a link, either do the <a> tag, or do this cool thing where you put links at the bottom formatted like [hiddentag]: <link> and in the body you put [Display name][hiddentag] here's an example: -->

[Link to server][examplehiddentag] 
[Link to YouTube Channel][youtube]

[Design][mjt] from [Alex Carpenter][ac]

[ac]: https://github.com/alexcarpenter
[mjt]: https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme
[examplehiddentag]: https://discord.gg/yK3tXpR
[youtube]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXJcV1AQo7N8D_PCdjdofA
<!-- you can keep the hiddentags and links at the bottom so they don't clutter -->
