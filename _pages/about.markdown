Here's some links that will take you to whereever you want. Btw thanks to Mi460 for helping me build this website :)



<!--- hey so mgc whenever you want to add a link, either do the <a> tag, or do this cool thing where you put links at the bottom formatted like [hiddentag]: <link> and in the body you put [Display name][hiddentag] here's an example: -->

[Link to server][examplehiddentag] 

[Link to YouTube Channel][youtube]

[Design][mjt] from [Alex Carpenter][ac]

[mjt]: https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme
[examplehiddentag]: https://discord.gg/yK3tXpR

<!-- you can keep the hiddentags and links at the bottom so they don't clutter -->
